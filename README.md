# VulkanEngine

This is a small rendering engine developed for purposes of solving assignments in university courses "Interactive Computer Graphics" and "Computer Animations"
I plan to further expand this to something more concise and advanced, to possibly use it in my masther's thesis.
If you wish to run any of the code, I advize you to open the project files in Visual Studio and run it from there, or move the executable files (x64 folder) to the project directory and run the executable.
Most of the project was written in c++, using VulkanAPI as a graphics API.
